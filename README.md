Where's That Sat?
=================

[@WheresThatSat](https://twitter.com/#!/wheresthatsat) is a Twitter bot that provides current location information about mentioned satellites. It is based on [Chatterbot](http://muffinlabs.com/chatterbot.html) and [Ground Track Generator](https://github.com/anoved/Ground-Track-Generator).

To-Do
-----

- Don't reply to retweets of our own Tweets (look for capital "RT" before our name in replies?)
- some false positive replies for "GOES 7" in response to baseball scores... so and so "goes 7 in 1", etc.
- parse times in replies
- parse hash tags in replies as attribute requests
- allow selective reply to specified public tweets (eg, respond to designated vs all sat mentions)
- web mapper component
- heading & illumination/visibility attributes (to-do for gtg)
